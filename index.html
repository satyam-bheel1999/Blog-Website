            Troubleshooting is the process of diagnosing the source of a problem. It is used to fix Problems
            with hardware, software and many other products.The basic theory of Troubleshooting is that you start
            with the most genral possible problems, and then narrow it down to more spacific issues.<br>
            Troubleshooting is something we all have to do at some point, though some of us have to troubleshoot
            product problems more often then others.The good news is that, the more you do it, the more you learn
            and the better you get at fixing problems.

            from software bugs, compatibility issues, or insufficient system resources.<br>

            6. Storage problems: Running out of storage space is a common issue, especially if the device has limited
            internal storage or if users accumulate numerous photos, videos, or large apps. Insufficient storage can
            affect app installations, system updates, and overall device performance.<br>

            7. Screen issues: Physical damage or software glitches can cause problems with the phone's screen. These
            issues can include unresponsive touchscreens, dead pixels, screen flickering, or screen freezes.<br>

            8. Camera malfunctions: Problems with the camera app, blurry images, or the camera not working altogether
            can be frustrating. These issues may be caused by software glitches, hardware defects, or improper
            settings.<br>

            9. Charging problems: Charging-related issues can range from slow charging to the phone not charging at
            all. It could be due to a faulty charger, damaged charging port, or issues with the battery.<br>

            10. Software updates: Occasionally, software updates can cause problems such as system instability,
            decreased battery life, or compatibility issues with certain apps.<br><br>

            It's important to note that some of these problems can be resolved through troubleshooting steps or
            software updates, while others may require professional assistance or hardware repair.</p>
